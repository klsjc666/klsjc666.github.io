Question says Victims and Characters can be in "at most one" CrimeStory, implying 0 is possible, so you need 0,1.

The idea of comparing the size of two collections to see whether something is in one but not the other is a good one that often works - but it does not work here, because your model does not ensure that the set of linked Victims is a subset of the set of linked Characters.

Well done!

While not explicitly in the diagram, it is reasonable to expect that there's some purpose to passing an A as an argument to B's init method, and hence assigning B's attribute of type A inside init would make sense.
