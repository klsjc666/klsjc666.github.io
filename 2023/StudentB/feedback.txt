A1: 40

I was going to say, don't invent, re numOfCharacters, numOfVictims - then I saw that you had cheekily invented that in order to make A2 doable! I will not penalise it here, but also not allow it there. See video for what was expected.

A2: 4

An attempt at the OCL, but doesn't really work - see video for solution.




B: 30

Well done!

While not explicitly in the diagram, it is reasonable to expect that there's some purpose to passing an A as an argument to B's init method, and hence assigning B's attribute of type A inside init would make sense.
