Don't put brackets round your OCL when it is in a Note. (When OCL is placed directly on a diagram, you use [] to denote a guard, and {} to denote a constraint, but the brackets are not part of the OCL.)

The bar method should return the result of a.foo() rather than "this".

The foo method should invoke the init method by sending itself (since in the diagram, the "a" is the same as the object name).

Why does your foo send the newly created B object the bar message? There's no sign of that in the sequence diagram.
