There is no need to name an association when it is an aggregation, because "contains" or "is part of" or similar is implied by the aggregation symbol.

Don't put brackets round your OCL when it is in a Note. (When OCL is placed directly on a diagram, you use [] to denote a guard, and {} to denote a constraint, but the brackets are not part of the OCL.)

This is an invariant on CrimeStory, so your opening line needs to be "context CrimeStory inv:"

Not really OCL! See solution in the video.
