B: 26

The foo method should invoke the init method by sending itself (since in the diagram, the "a" is the same as the object name).

You have an unneeded and unused attribute.

While not explicitly in the class diagram, it is reasonable to expect that there's some purpose to passing an A as an argument to B's init method, and hence assigning B's attribute of type A inside init would make sense.
