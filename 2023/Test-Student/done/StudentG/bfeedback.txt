B: 30

Well done!

While not explicitly in the class diagram, it is reasonable to expect that there's some purpose to passing an A as an argument to B's init method, and hence assigning B's attribute of type A inside init would make sense.

Note that you should try to avoid using var as a type whenever you can. Here you know the types of the variables, so you can just use those.
