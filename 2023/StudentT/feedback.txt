You were asked to show aggregations to CrimeStory (diamond arrow heads).

The question said to put the OCL invariant in a Note (particular UML shape with a representation of a turned-over corner).

The (default) role name is character, not characters, because it is the name of the class, lower-cased.

Close to correct, but > is not defined on sets.

Well done!

While not explicitly in the diagram, it is reasonable to expect that there's some purpose to passing an A as an argument to B's init method, and hence assigning B's attribute of type A inside init would make sense.

1. Syntax: in an object diagram the instanceName : ClassifierName needs to be underlined.

1. Good! You could have shown the attribute value name = "foo" in your Operation, but this is enough for the part 1 marks.

2. Close! You want -> includes rather than . contains, and remember the default role name is the class name lower-cased, so operation.

3. Correct!

4. Correct!

5. Good as far as it goes but a little non-specific!
