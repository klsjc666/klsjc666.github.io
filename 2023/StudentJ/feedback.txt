It looks as though you didn't use the Lucid UML notation to the full, e.g. the diamond arrow heads.

The question said to put the OCL invariant in a Note (particular UML shape with a representation of a turned-over corner).

The sequence diagram does not show the bar method creating a new object of class A. Instead, consider giving class B an attribute of type A.

While not explicitly in the diagram, it is reasonable to expect that there's some purpose to passing an A as an argument to B's init method, and hence assigning B's attribute of type A inside init would make sense.
